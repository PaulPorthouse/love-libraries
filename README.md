# Lua Libraries

These files are a set of custom libraries for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html), specifically written for use with the [LÃ–VE framework](https://love2d.org/).

# Tests

At least some of the modules have tests written for them. To run the tests, run the following powershell script

```
.\runtests.ps1
```

# Deployment

To deploy the libraries to a project, copy the entire data structure to a new sub-directory in the project.
